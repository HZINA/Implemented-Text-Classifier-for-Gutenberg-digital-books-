# Implemented-Text-Classifier-for-Gutenberg-digital-books-
➢ Collected documents from the Gutenberg library, performed document segmentation, and
labeled the document
➢ Performed feature engineering using bag of words, TF-IDF, and N-Gram techniques -NLTK
➢ Trained several models to predict the author and the genre of the document using crossvalidation technique and machine learning algorithms including Multinomial Naive Bayes,
K- Nearest Neighbours (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Pandas and scikit-learn
➢ Performed model evaluation based on accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score
