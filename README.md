### Implemented Text Classifier for-Gutenberg digital books

* Collected documents from the Gutenberg library, performed document segmentation, and
labeled the document

* Performed feature engineering using bag of words, TF-IDF, and N-Gram techniques -NLTK

* Trained several models to predict the author and the genre of the document using crossvalidation technique and machine learning algorithms including Multinomial Naive Bayes,
K- Nearest Neighbours (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) - with Pandas and scikit-learn

* Performed model evaluation based on accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score
